## What does QD Chat Reader do?
The QD Chat Reader reads out the QuizClash chat stored on your mobile device and stores it on your PC. It reads the chat database and shows the chats included in it. At the moment, **only iOS 9 devices** are supported and tested.
## What does "QD" stand for?
QD is a commonly used abbreviation for Quizduell, the German version of QuizClash. The German community is the largest for this game.

## How does it work?
The QD Chat Reader does _not_ directly connect to your device, but scans its backup on your PC. It searches for a chat database, reads out the chats, and displays it sorted by chat partners.

## Why is only iOS (iPhone, iPad) supported?
I can only test and develop this entertaining non-commercial hobby project on my own hardware. And this is Apple.

## The thing runs under Windows...!
Yes, dear Apple friends, exactly. You will need Windows on a PC or Mac.

## Isn't there a way for Android, somehow?
Reading out the database should work as well on Android. Clever contemporaries may test this and report to me.

## What do I have to do to read out the chat?
First you make a backup of your device on your PC. This means iTunes in case of Apple. The QD Chat Reader helps to find the chat database inside this backup.
Once a chat database is found, it can display the chats included.

## Will all chats be read out?
Only chats, already stored on your mobile device, can be read out. But it does not matter, whether the gamers are in your current list. On Aplle devices, potentially all chats ever been made will be stored on the device, and can be read out here. Unless you did not delete them...

## Why can't I see the names of my chat partners, but numbers instead?
The database does not contain the names of your chat partners, but ID numbers instead. The names will be transmitted from FEO during gameplay, because a gamer may change it.
But QD Chat Reader allows you to replace the ID number by a name. This replaces the ID permanently.

## Why is it so complicated - with a backup?
Apple did a great job to secure your mobile device. The backup is the only chance to access the database.

## What has this to do with FEO?
No, FEO is not involved here in any stage. There is no data exchange with FEO. Only the existing database from your mobile device will be read from a backup on your PC.

## Where can I get more support?
