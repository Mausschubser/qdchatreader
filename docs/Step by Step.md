# Step by Step Instruction
## Make a backup in iTunes
QD Chat Reader retrieves the chat database from an iTunes Backup.
Make an +unencrypted+ backup from your mobile device.
This may take a while. Don't forget to switch on the encryption after all.

## Run QD Chat Reader and seek database 
The QD Chat Reader assists you finding the chat database in your iTunes backup.
Run QD Chat Reader.

## A: Open database or search for a new one
The last selected database will be opened automatically. You can select any other existing database with the button **"Select Chat DB"** . 
![](Step by Step_1539075)
In case you never have searched for a database before, you can open the Search & Scan dialog with **"Scan Backup..."** .

### Search through iTunes Backup for a new database
![](Step by Step_1539076)
# Use **"Search in..."** to select the location of your backup. You can also select the **"iTunes default"** folder.
# Let QD Chat Reader make a **"Database scan"** in your backup. Once it found a chat database, it will be listed in the table below. You can wait until the scan ends automatically, or **"Stop scanning!"** manually.
# Pick a database from the list by clicking on it.
# Save this database with **"Save as..."** at a new location, e.g. "My Documents". Otherwise you won't be able to read the chats after backup encryption is switched on again.
# You may use the found database directly by click on **"Use selected"**. But it is recommended to save it to a copy by **"Save as..."**. This will finally close the dialog and you return to the main window of QD Chat Reader.

## B: Select the chat partner
Pick a chat partner from the list **"Chat Partners"**. You will now read the chat with this person.

## C: Change ID to name
![](Step by Step_1540754)
Initially, the chat partner list shows ID number instead of names. Once you identified a chat partner, you can enter his/her real or nick name in the field **"Chat with:"**. This will be used in the future instead of the ID.

## D: Save the chat to a file
**"Save Chat..."** allows to save the shown chat in a text file. You can open this file in a text editor or spreadsheet program.

## Turn the backup encrytion back on in iTunes!
Switch on again the backup encryption in iTunes! Once you saved the database with **"Save as..."** you will be able to read the chats at any time.
